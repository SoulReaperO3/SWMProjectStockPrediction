Note: The predict.py testing script expects the following trained model pickle files in 'model-training' directory
1. logistic_regression-pca-one-gram-one-day-mixed-data-model.pkl
2. random_forest-XGBoost-pca-one-gram-one-day-mixed-data-3k-30-model.pkl
3. random-forest-pca-one-gram-one-day-mixed-data-model.pkl
4. svm-pca-one-gram-one-day-mixed-data-model.pkl

The sizes of these trained models are in GBs so they could not be uploaded to git repo. These files can be instead downloaded from the following drive link:
